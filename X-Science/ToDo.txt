--- NEXT ----------------------------------------
Add new options to help
Settings window is getting ugly

In selected object window - Is controlable + Has lab + Total amount of science stored

Move decisions as to what is completed into a function
Setting for when things are considered completed
If something has 0 science collected then it cant be completed
--------------------------------------------------





Funding
----------------------------------------------------

Biome list, has Lab, list of vessels
Check map for water biomes.
----------------------------------------------------


Need red icons
rename window
img/sprite class - Load all in one place
Visibility is weird.


Pop icon when necessary.
Put each icon into class
Give icon to own window

* Window class config
* Window width
* Store pre-calculated content where possible.

 Sprite.Create(texture, rect, pivot);

 

The rectangle parameter is the source rectangle on the texture. If you want to use the whole texture as the sprite, use new Rect(0, 0, texture.width, texture.height);

I believe the pivot is actually a percentage and not a pixel/unit value. So if you wanted to pivot at the center of the texture you would use new Vector2(0.5f, 0.5f)

Sorry for the pseudo code, away from Unity at the moment.

Hope this helps!





=======================================


    http://unity3d.com/support/documentation/ScriptReference/Texture2D.GetPixels.html


        function GetPixels (x : int, y : int, blockWidth : int, blockHeight : int, miplevel : int) : Color[]
        Description

        Get a block of pixel colors.

        This function is an extended version of GetPixels above; it does not return the whole mip level but only blockWidth by blockHeight region starting at x,y. The block must fit into the used mip level. The returned array is blockWidth*blockHeight size.

    to write them back:

    http://unity3d.com/support/documentation/ScriptReference/Texture2D.SetPixels.html

        function SetPixels (x : int, y : int, blockWidth : int, blockHeight : int, colors : Color[], miplevel : int) : void
        Description

        Set a block of pixel colors.

        This function is an extended version of SetPixels above; it does not modify the whole mip level but modifies only blockWidth by blockHeight region starting at x,y. The colors array must be blockWidth*blockHeight size, and the modified block must fit into the used mip level.

     

==================

    Check the GetPixels and SetPixels funcitons in Texture2D. It sounds like you should have a good idea of what to do from there.
     
=========================


    You can also use this if you want to copy the whole texture:

        // duplicate the original texture
        var texture : Texture2D = Instantiate(renderer.material.mainTexture);

    You can also reference the whole texture:

        // reference the original texture
        var texture : Texture2D = renderer.material.mainTexture;

//ResourceMap.Instance.IsPlanetScanned(body.flightGlobalsIndex);

--- Pass data to an event -------------------------------------------------
Make a new EventArgs class such as:

    public class ListEventArgs : EventArgs
    {
        public List<string> Data { get; set; }
        public ListEventArgs(List<string> data)
        {
            Data = data;
        }
    }

And make your event as this:

    public event EventHandler<ListEventArgs> NewFileAdded;

Add a firing method:

protected void OnNewFileAdded(List<string> data)
{
    var localCopy = NewFileAdded;
    if (localCopy != null)
    {
        localCopy(this, new ListEventArgs(data));
    }
}

And when you want to handle this event:

myObj.NewFileAdded += new EventHandler<ListEventArgs>(myObj_NewFileAdded);

The handler method would appear like this:

public void myObj_NewFileAdded(object sender, ListEventArgs e)
{
       // Do what you want with e.Data (It is a List of string)
}
